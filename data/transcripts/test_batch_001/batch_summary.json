  "summary_content": "# Research Findings: Customer Research Interview Batch\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nConducted 8 interviews with Product Managers at B2B SaaS companies. Key finding: PMs spend 40% of their time in document coordination across teams, with manual synthesis of research taking 3-5 weeks per project.\n\n## Recurrent Patterns\n\n- All participants manually compile interview notes into shared documents\n- Document versions create confusion (email, Slack, Google Docs chaos)\n- No standardized format for capturing research insights\n- Synthesis step is repetitive and error-prone\n\n## Relevant Divergences\n\n- Small team enthusiasts: Want ease-of-use and quick setup\n- Enterprise security teams: Require extensive compliance certifications\n- Finance: Concerned about per-user costs vs. annual budgets\n\n## Identified Tensions\n\n- Desire for advanced features (real-time collaboration, AI synthesis)\n- Concern about data security and compliance (SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR)\n- Uncertainty about cost-benefit analysis for teams < 20 people\n- Integration complexity with existing enterprise tools\n\n## Notable Absences\n\n- No mention of AI features in security-conscious segments\n- Limited interest in mobile-first approach (web/desktop preferred)\n\n## Key Quotes\n\n- \"I spend more time consolidating feedback than listening to customers\"\n- \"Every research project, we start from scratch rebuilding the same structure\"\n- \"Our exec team wants PR-FAQ format but it takes weeks to create\"\n- \"Consistency across projects would help with pattern recognition\"\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. Create automated synthesis tool that generates PR-FAQ from interviews\n2. Standardize document format for consistency\n3. Enable version control and collaboration features\n4. Support multiple export formats (PDF, Markdown, HTML)\n5. Emphasize security-first architecture and compliance certifications\n6. Offer flexible pricing for small vs. enterprise deployments"
